The code entails the following :
a) motion detection using optical flow
b) dense as well as sparse (lukas-kanade) optical flow has been used
c) motion detcetion using absolute differenec between two frames.
d) detecting circles using hsv space.
e) tracking single objects using boosting, TLD, KCF etc.
